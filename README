Compiled using gcc.

Change the IFACE_IP macro in packet_maker.c to your interface of choices ip.
Run the makefile.
Run ./send_packet with options:
	-d: destination address
	-s: source address
	-i: identification
	-v: version
	-f: flags
	-o: offset
	-t: ttl
	-p: protocol

Write the payload you want to send to stdin manually or pipe it.

Don't forget that the payload must be encapsulated in its own header(s).

Max payload size on this version is 64. You can easily change it with the DG_BUFFER macro in packet_maker.c if you feel the need.
